"# YouTubeSummaryPipeline" 

In order to use this repo you need an installation of Python 3.10.
I highly recommend to create an Miniconda environment for this project.
First, navigate to your downloaded directory.
When you have created your environment install the required packages by running:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After this step you should have all required packages and then you can open Jupyter Lab by typing:
- `jupyter lab`

Now a new browser windows should open and then select from the file-list on the left:
- `YouTubeSummaryPipeline.ipynb`

Now you just need to insert your link and your Open-AI login credentials/session_token and you are ready tu run the notebook!
